# Discount Eden Demo

[My Notes](notes.md)

This project will essentially be a placeholder for a prototype, exhibiting the user interface I'd like to develop for a more long term project.

> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

This application supports the web player of a WIP Unity webGL creative tool, incorporating placeholders of all of the UI functionality I want to offer to users when the game is complete. It should provide a set of placehodlers to support project persistence, account management, and optional downloads. The core game will likely be in development for some time, but this project should entail most of the web infrastructure required to support it.

### Design

- **Service** - Used to let users access saved project data.
